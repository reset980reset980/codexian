Codexian is a desktop-only Obsidian plugin that brings OpenAI Codex into your vault as a sidebar agent. It is designed for note-aware coding, writing, refactoring, local automation, and visual SVG asset generation from your Obsidian notes.

## Current Release

Latest BRAT release: **0.1.9**

Install with:

```text
https://github.com/reallygood83/codexian
```

Core chat works through your authenticated Codex CLI session. Codexian does **not** require an OpenAI API key for normal chat use.

## Features

- **Codex sidebar**: Ask Codex to work with your vault from an Obsidian-native chat panel.
- **Current-note context**: Active note content and selected text are automatically attached to prompts.
- **Pinned note context**: Pin important notes so they stay attached even when you switch files.
- **Dismissible note context**: Use the `x` button on a note chip when you want to work without that note being sent to Codex.
- **Stable note chips**: Current-note chips stay visible when the sidebar takes focus, matching ObsidianCode behavior.
- **Attach current note command**: Use Obsidian's hotkey settings to bind `Codexian: Attach current note to chat`.
- **Fast composer UX**: Press Enter to send, or Shift+Enter for a new line.
- **ObsidianCode legacy UI**: The chat shell, message bubbles, input box, toolbar, note chips, and stylesheet are carried from ObsidianCode's `.oc-*` legacy.
- **Clean Codex replies**: Codexian reads Codex's final response from `--output-last-message` so session headers, hooks, and token logs stay out of the chat.
- **Visible Codex progress**: Important Codex CLI status lines are shown while the final answer is being generated.
- **Vault working directory**: Codex runs with the vault as its working root.
- **Permission modes**: Review, Auto, and Yolo modes map to Codex sandbox behavior.
- **No API key for core use**: Codexian uses your authenticated Codex CLI session, like ObsidianCode uses Claude Code CLI.
- **Codex visual assets**: Generate SVG infographics, posters, cartoons, concept-art boards, or diagram-like illustrations from note context.
- **Automatic visual embedding**: Generated SVG files are saved into the configured attachment folder and embedded with `![[...]]`.
- **oh-my-codex setup**: Settings include diagnostics and an install/update flow for Codex CLI plus OMX.
- **macOS and Windows aware**: CLI detection, diagnostics, and command previews adapt by platform.

## Why Codexian?

Obsidian is where many people keep their project notes, research, drafts, and plans. Codexian makes that vault directly actionable: Codex can read the note you are working on, reason over it, and help transform it into code, structured writing, or generated visual assets.

The plugin also gives power users a path into [oh-my-codex](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex), while keeping basic Codex usage independent from OMX.

## Requirements

- Obsidian desktop.
- Node.js 20+.
- OpenAI Codex CLI installed and authenticated.
- Optional: oh-my-codex for OMX workflows.

Recommended CLI setup:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex oh-my-codex
codex login
omx setup
omx doctor
```

On Windows, use PowerShell. If advanced OMX team runtime features are unstable natively, WSL remains a practical fallback.

## Installation For Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Copy these files into your vault:

```text
<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/codexian/
  main.js
  manifest.json
  styles.css
```

Then enable **Codexian** in Obsidian settings.

## Installing With BRAT

Codexian supports BRAT installation from GitHub releases.

1. Install **Obsidian42 - BRAT** from Obsidian Community Plugins.
2. Open BRAT settings.
3. Click **Add Beta Plugin**.
4. Paste the Codexian GitHub repository URL:

```text
https://github.com/reallygood83/codexian
```

5. Enable **Codexian** in Obsidian Community Plugins.

Each release includes the files BRAT needs:

- `main.js`
- `manifest.json`
- `styles.css`

If BRAT does not update immediately, use BRAT's plugin update command or restart Obsidian.

## Note Context Workflow

Codexian is designed to make Obsidian notes feel native inside Codex CLI:

- Open a note and Codexian automatically detects it.
- Click the pin icon to keep a note attached while you switch files.
- Click `x` to remove a note from Codexian context when you want a note-independent conversation.
- Run `Codexian: Attach current note to chat` from Obsidian commands or bind it to a hotkey.
- Ask Codex normally; Codexian sends the selected note context through Codex CLI.

## Planned: Memory Map

The next major feature direction is **Codexian Memory Map**: a one-button way to find relevant notes in your vault.

Planned user flow:

1. Click **Build Memory Map** once to index the vault locally.
2. Open any note.
3. Click **Find Context** or use a hotkey.
4. Codexian recommends related notes with clear reasons.
5. Add useful notes to the chat context with `+`.

The first version will use a local rule-based index of note titles, tags, links, backlinks, headings, keywords, folders, and modified times. This gives fast results without an API key. Later versions can add optional local embeddings, Ollama embeddings, or OpenAI API embeddings while keeping the default workflow simple.

## Release Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and uploads BRAT assets when a tag matching the manifest version is pushed, for example:

```bash
git tag 0.1.0
git push origin 0.1.0
```

## Configuration

Open Obsidian Settings → Community plugins → Codexian.

- Set `Codex CLI path` only if auto-detection fails.
- Codexian auto-detects common macOS, Windows, Homebrew, npm, and NVM Codex paths and can store the detected path for you.
- Add `PATH` under environment variables only if Obsidian cannot find `codex`, `npm`, or `omx`.
- Choose your Codex model and reasoning effort.
- Run diagnostics before using the one-click OMX installer.
- Keep `Review` permission mode until you trust the current vault workflow.

## Visual Generation

Use the command **Generate visual asset from active note** or the sidebar button.

Codexian can generate:

- Infographics
- Posters
- Cartoons
- Concept art
- Diagram-like illustrations

The generated SVG is created by Codex CLI, saved to the configured media folder, and appended to the active note as an Obsidian embed.

This is intentionally not an OpenAI Images API integration. Codexian is designed to work from your Codex CLI subscription/login without requiring separate API billing.

## Security Notes

- Review mode is the safest default.
- Yolo mode maps to Codex's dangerous bypass mode and should only be used in trusted, backed-up vaults.
- The OMX installer shows command previews and logs setup output.

## Project Status

This project is in early MVP development. The current implementation prioritizes a working Obsidian plugin foundation:

- Codex CLI execution is implemented behind a provider boundary.
- Codex-powered SVG visual asset generation is implemented without API keys.
- ObsidianCode-style chat UI and note context chips are implemented.
- Active-note, pinned-note, hotkey attach, and dismissible note context are implemented.
- OMX diagnostics and install/update UI are implemented.
- Memory Map, deeper tool-call rendering, diff previews, and long-term conversation persistence are planned.
